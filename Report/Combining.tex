\section{Combining measurements from multiple fuel streams}\label{Combining}

If multiple fuel streams are sampled, then measurements may be combined to obtain an estimate of the average annual EF for all fuel streams combined. A lower relative uncertainty can be obtained if the measurements can be obtained. The statistical methodology, including the optimal allocation of sample sizes across fuel streams to minimize the relative uncertainty, is outlined in chapter 5.5 in \citet{Cochran77}.
